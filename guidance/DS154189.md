# Unsafe C functions

## Summary

Vulnerabilities in banned non-managed C/C++ standard libraries for string processing and memory
(eg. strcpy, memcpy) allocation may lead to command execution, stack overflow and segmentation 
faults that may be exploited by attackers. Use safer alternatives instead.
