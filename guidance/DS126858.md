# Broken/weak cryptographic hash algorithms

## Summary

Weak hashing algorithms such as SHA1, MD and others can lead to fradulent representation of the
integrity and origins of critical data such as certificates or messages by allowing attackers to
tamper with it undetected. Use SHA-256 or higher.
