# Hashing low-entropy content

## Summary

Taking a hash of a time value or other low entropy source is suspicious and possibly unsafe as 
there is insufficient entropy to protect against brute-force attacks.  Ensure unique identification
of data especially in a security context uses high entropy sources.
