# Use of DES symetric block ciper

## Summary

The [Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard), or DES, is a
dated symmetric block cipher that should not be used except in legacy applications and after careful
review by a security expert. Use modern cryptographic block ciphers such as AES instead.
